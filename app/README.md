### Test your application on Rinkeby network

To run all examples on rinkeby network you need:

1. set `NODE_URL` env variable to specific link (you can use infura endpoints)
(By default, node url link connects to localhost)
2. set `ACCOUNTS_FILENAME` env variable as name of file you want to use, file should be located in contracts folder. By default, it will use `accounts.json`
3. set `NETWORK` env variable to network you would like to use (`rinkeby`, `robsten`). By default, network will be `localhost`.
